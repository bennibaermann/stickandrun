Stick And Run
=============

Stick and Run is a very simple game inspired by the mobile game "Stick
Hero" with some simple improvements.

Stil in early pre-alpha.

Gameplay 
--------

just hold any key or mouse button to increase the length of your
stick. perfect matches give increasing bonus if you match more than
one in a row.

Installation 
------------

You need python and pygame. Under Debian/Ubuntu and similar systems the
following should work:

	apt-get install python python-pygame 
	git clone https://github.com/bennibaermann/maximetro.git 
	maximetro/maximetro.py 

I have no idea how to install in other systems. But in general you need
python and pygame and than clone the git repository (or download the
zip from github). The underlying technologies (SDL, Pygame, Python) are all 
very portable, so it should be possible to run it more or less on any system
which runs python.

Have fun.
